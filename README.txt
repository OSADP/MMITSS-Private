Open Source Overview
============================
MMITSS AMS consists of the source-code for the MMITSS application used in the AMS Project (Analysis, Modeling and Simulation Testbeds for DMA and ATDM Evaluation). MMITSS stands for Multi Modal Intelligent Traffic Signal System and consists of five different application - I-SIG, FSP, TSP, PREEMPT and PED-SIG. Details on these applications are provided at http://www.its.dot.gov/research_archives/dma/bundle/mmitss_plan.htm.

The repository focuses on the I-SIG application and is prototyped as a Software-in-the-Loop system for controlling eight intersections in San Mateo's El-Camino Real Testbed.The application requires two computers - one running Windows to perform simulations using Vissim and the other running Linux to run Docker instances that replicate each of the eight intersection controllers. These applications are provided in two different folders within the repository.

For further details on the applications, users are encouraged to read the following FHWA documents:
